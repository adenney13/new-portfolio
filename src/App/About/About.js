                        As a passionate, formally trained musician and bar manager, I not only have a love for learning the inner-workings of all things, but Iâ€™m fiercely loyal in not quitting until a job is completed. As a strong bar manager, I developed interpersonal, customer service, and group critical thinking skills that would make me not only an effective part of any team, but a great person to work with and for. Whether writing a song, crafting a cocktail, or coding, I relish figuring out the perfect formula and tweaking the details to make something new and fresh, not just for myself but for others to experience as well.
